### OV7670 Camera Module

#### Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to interface an OV7670 camera module with an Arduino board to capture image frames. The captured frames can be processed and utilized for various applications such as image processing, computer vision, or surveillance.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Board**
2. **OV7670 Camera Module**
3. **Jumper Wires**

#### Instructions

1. **Set Up the Circuit:**
   - Connect the OV7670 camera module to the Arduino board using jumper wires.

2. **Initialize the Camera:**
   - Initialize the OV7670 camera module using the provided library.
   - Check if the camera module is detected. If not detected, an error message will be displayed.

3. **Set Camera Resolution:**
   - Set the desired resolution for capturing image frames. In this example, the resolution is set to QVGA (Quarter VGA).

4. **Capture Image Frames:**
   - Continuously capture image frames using the `captureFrame()` function.
   - Process and store the captured frames as required for the specific application (not implemented in this example).

#### Applications

- **Image Processing:** Utilize captured image frames for image processing tasks such as object recognition, edge detection, or feature extraction.
- **Computer Vision:** Implement computer vision algorithms for tasks such as facial recognition, gesture recognition, or object tracking.
- **Surveillance Systems:** Integrate the camera module into surveillance systems for monitoring and security purposes.

#### Notes

- Additional processing of the captured image frames can be implemented based on specific project requirements.
